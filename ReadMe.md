## Introduction

The idea behind creating secured web applications is far from a new concept. In modern coding practices there are many ways to secure your applications, but the one we will cover in this repository will be setting up the front and back end using tokenization.

For coverage on the topic of tokenization, please refer to the `on-tokenization.md` file in this repository.

## Reading Order

### For the Tokenization Novice

- First brush up on Tokenization concepts by reading `on-tokenization.md`
- Next, choose your backend and read the corresponding file (`wp-setup.md` for wordpress, or `python-setup.md` for python)
- Finally, you will need to configure your FrontEnd webapp to work with the api you've developed, so read the `react-setup.md` document.

### For all those versed with Tokenization that just want to dig in

- To learn how to setup your backend, choose your backend technology and read the corresponding file (`wp-setup.md` for wordpress, or `python-setup.md` for python)
- Finally, you will need to configure your FrontEnd webapp to work with the api you've developed, so read the `react-setup.md` document.

## Conclusion

This write-up was originally meant as a top level overview of users and tokens with your application and not as an in-depth breakdown. However, we have plans to grow this knowledge set for other frameworks and languages in the future.

You will probably need to tailor the approach to your specific app, but hopefully you have gained some insight into working with JWT and tokenization.
